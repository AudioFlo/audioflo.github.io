"Midnight Pancakes"

Evie’s all-night diner fed truckers, but she loved the quiet.
Then he arrived - leather jacket, broken cup. “Maple syrup?” he rasped. “For my cactus.”
She laughed. Poured. Their hands brushed.

He returned nightly with odd gifts: a street-found flower, a rain noise record.

Rain poured. His bike died. “Need help?” She offered her bicycle.
They rode, soaked. He stopped. “I fix radios. Yours is broken.”
“Mine works—”
He pressed a button into her palm. “Makes songs magic.”

He hummed. Rain hushed.

Now, the diner plays his song. Evie serves heart-shaped pancakes.
The cup? Blooming with daisies.
