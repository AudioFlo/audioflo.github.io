"Dumpy’s Big Adventure"

Dumpy, the dumpling fell off the plate. “Let’s go!” He rolled past a cranky onion, avoided a swinging spoon, and slid out the kitchen window. Outside!

Wind pushed him to a park. A ladybug said, “Follow the noodle path!” Dumpy moved on—over tiny hills of crumbs, through big puddles.

Dumpy met Bao, a smiling bun. “Come with me!”

They slid down a banana peel, rode a celery stick, and found the noodle path’s end—a shiny soy sauce fall.

“Go home?” Bao shook his head. “Let’s find the Spicy Mountain!”

Now, they climb pizza box piles and show scared spring rolls how to roll.
