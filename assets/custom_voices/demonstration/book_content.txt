One sunny afternoon, a girl named Kara flew her bright red kite in the park. 
Suddenly! A gust of wind tugged the string from her hands, and the kite sailed away into the sky.

Kara chased it, climbing a hill so high it touched the clouds. 

There, she found her kite tangled in a fluffy, grumpy cloud named Nimbus. "You ruined my nap!" Nimbus grumbled.

"I’m sorry!" said Kara. "Can I help?"

Nimbus sighed. "The sky’s been gray for days. We clouds forgot how to make rainbows!"

Kara had an idea. She untied the ribbons from her kite which have red, blue, and yellow color.

"Mix these!" she said. Nimbus blew gently, swirling the colors together. A rainbow exploded across the sky!

The clouds cheered, dancing in zigzags and swirls. "Thank you, Kara!" Nimbus beamed. "Let’s send you home!"

Nimbus puffed up, lifting Kara and her kite onto his back. "Wheee!" They zoomed down to the park, where her dad waved.

Now, whenever it rains, Kara smiles. She knows the clouds are painting rainbows. if you squint, you’ll see a tiny red kite in the colors!
