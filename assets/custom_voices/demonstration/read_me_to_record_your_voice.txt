"A Big Day of a Hungry Dog"

Buddy, the dog loved food. Really loved it.

One morning, he ate Mia’s birthday cake. “Oh no!” Mia cried. “Bad boy!”

But Buddy didn’t stop. He licked ice cream, chomped eggs, and even swallowed Uncle Joe’s underpants, which are drying in the sun.

“Catch him!” shouted Mia’s dad. Buddy zoomed under the table, knocked over a lamp, and hid in the laundry basket.

Mia peeked inside. Buddy wagged his tail, covered in socks. She giggled. “You’re silly!”

That night, Buddy burped loudly, and got a medal for “World’s Hungriest Dog.”
