   "introduction": "She wants to be alone. Being crowded, hemmed in by other people make her feel smothered. Traveling, airports, are stifling with their crowds, the pressure of people. After visiting her family, Jenny wants nothing more to get home where she can be alone... and breathe. Turning inward is her usual defense, but perhaps... in our strange universe, she can encounter some sort of special service for loners. A short surreal story digitally narrated.",
   "author_comment": "I listened to Alone (Della) all the way through and it isn't bad at all. Again, thanks for your assistance in getting the hang of this."
