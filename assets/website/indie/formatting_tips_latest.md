# Audiobook Manuscript Guide

## Why this matters

Audiobook scripts often require slight adjustments from the written text. Certain punctuation marks or formatting choices may confuse AI narration, affecting the flow and clarity. To ensure a smooth listening experience, we recommend making the following edits:

---

## 1. Date, Time, and Numbers

Use full phrasing for clarity:

- ❌ She had her **18th** birthday on the **3rd of November**.  
- ✅ She had her **eighteenth** birthday on the **third of November**.

- ❌ She was in her **60s**  
- ✅ She was in her **sixties**

- ❌ **5 a.m**  
- ✅ **5 AM**

---

## 2. Punctuation Marks

Some symbols can cause errors or awkward pauses. Please follow these guidelines:

### Quotations (`“ ”`, `‘ ’`)
- ✅ Our narrators are able to handle quotations pretty well.

### Apostrophes (`’`)
- ✅ Didn’t and aren’t  
- ✅ parents’ house

### Colon and Semicolon (`:` `;`)
- ✅ I wanted to go for a walk; it started raining.  
- ✅ She brought three things: a notebook, a pen, and a flashlight.

### Slashes (`/`, `\`)
- ❌ 1980 in Frankfurt / Main  
- ✅ 1980 in Frankfurt, Main

### Asterisks (`*`)
- ❌ *she lied to us*  
- ✅ She lied to us

### Emoji
- ❌ I love ♫  
- ✅ I love music

### Long Dashes (`---`)
- ❌ I was going to call you - - - - then I remembered you were out of town.  
- ✅ I was going to call you — then I remembered you were out of town.  
  _Suggestion: replace with simpler punctuation like a period or comma._

### Number Sign (`#`)
- ❌ #1 Get a car  
- ✅ number one. Get a car

### Parentheses (`()`)
- ✅ I love your story (so much) → sounds like: I love your story so much  
- ⚠️ Arno (15) had lied to me → sounds like: Arno 15 had lied to me

### Brackets (`[ ]`)
- ❌ He said he would arrive, [but he didn’t show up]  
- ✅ He said he would arrive, but he didn’t show up

### Braces (`{ }`)
- ❌ The set of vowels in English is {a, e, i, o, u}.  
- ✅ The set of vowels in English is a, e, i, o, u.

### Backquote and Tilde (`` ` ``, `~`)
- ⚠️ These are primarily used in computer programming. Please don’t confuse them with apostrophes.

### Mixed-use of Multiple Punctuations
- ⚠️ What are you doing there ?!? → would sound like: What are you doing there?

---

## 3. Spacing

- ✅ Standard spacing works perfectly.
- ⚠️ If you're copying your manuscript from a PDF or Word document, watch out for extra spaces introduced during conversion.

---

## 4. Abbreviations

- ❌ WW II  
- ✅ World War two

- ❌ 10 lbs, and 5 ft.  
- ✅ 10 pound and 5 foot

- ✅ Mr. and Dr.  
- ✅ Mister and Doctor

- ❌ St.Tropez  
- ✅ Saint Tropez

---

## 5. Special Names and Foreign Languages  
_If the primary narration language is English_

These will be pronounced phonetically:

### German Names
- ✅ Ralf and Monika → sounds like Ralph and Monica

### French Words
- ⚠️ “Menage-a-trois” and “cul-de-sac” may not sound very French

### Brand Names and Made-Up Names
- ✅ Pampers → sounds like Pam-pers

### Foreign Cities Pronounced Differently in English
- ⚠️ Please change “Nice, France” to “Neece, France”
